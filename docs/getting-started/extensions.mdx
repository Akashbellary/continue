### Hub Assistants

When you [sign in to Continue Hub](https://auth.continue.dev/), you get access to pre-configured assistants that sync automatically across your IDE sessions. To learn more about all the features available in Continue Hub, check out our [hub introduction](/hub/introduction). These assistants are:

- **Easy to set up** - Add an assistant from [hub.continue.dev](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/assistants) to your account
- **Managed online** - Configure models, add secrets, and customize settings through the web interface
- **Automatically synced** - Changes made on the hub reflect immediately in your IDE
- **Shareable** - Create and share custom assistants with your team

To use Hub assistants:

1. Click the assistant selector above the chat input in your IDE
2. Browse available assistants or create your own
3. Add API keys as [User Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets) on the hub
4. Click "Reload config" to sync changes

### Local Assistants (config.yaml)

For advanced users who prefer local control, Continue supports configuration through a `config.yaml` file in your `~/.continue` directory. Local assistants offer:

- **Full control** - All configuration stored locally on your machine
- **Version control friendly** - Check your config into git for team consistency
- **Offline usage** - No internet required once models are configured
- **Advanced customization** - Access to all configuration options

To create a local assistant:

1. Create a `config.yaml` file in `~/.continue` (see [config.yaml reference page](/reference))
2. Configure your models, context providers, and other settings
3. Access local assistants through the gear icon in the assistant selector
