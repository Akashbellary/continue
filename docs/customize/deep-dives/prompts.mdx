Prompts are used to kick off workflows for Agent, Plan, and Chat requests. They are included as user messages.

They are especially useful as context for repetitive and/or complex tasks.

## Quick Start: How to Create Your First Prompt File

Below is a quick example of setting up a prompt file:

1. Create a folder called `.continue/prompts` at the top level of your workspace
2. Add a file called `redux-review-prompt.md` to this folder.
3. Write the following contents to `redux-review-prompt.md` and save.

```md title="review-prompt.md"
---
name: Redux best practices review
isPrompt: true
alwaysApply: false
---

Review the currently open file for adherence to Redux best practices, as explained in their style guide at https://redux.js.org/style-guide/.
```

Now to use this prompt, you can open Chat, type <kbd>/</kbd>, select the prompt, and type out any additional instructions you'd like to add.

### How to Create a Security Review Prompt

```md title="security-review.md"
---
name: Security best practices review
alwaysApply: false
---

Review the changes in the current git diff for these security best practices:

- Does the architecture follow security-by-design principles?
- Are there potential security vulnerabilities in the system design?
- Is sensitive data handled appropriately throughout the lifecycle?
```

### Agent Prompt Blocks

The easiest way to add a slash command is by adding [`prompt`](../../hub/blocks/block-types#prompts) to your agent, which show up as slash commands in Agent, Plan, and Chad mode.

These slash commands can be combined with additional instructions, including highlighted code.
