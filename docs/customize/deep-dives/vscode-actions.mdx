<Info>Currently all of these are only available in VS Code</Info>

To make common use cases even more accessible, we provide a handful of other ways to invoke actions in VS Code.

## How to Use Quick Actions

Quick Actions are displayed as buttons above top-level classes and functions in your source code, letting you invoke actions with one click. They will edit that class or function, but nothing outside of it. They can also be customized with [.prompt files](./prompts.md) to perform custom actions.

By default, quick actions are disabled, but can be enabled with the “Continue: Enable Quick Actions” in VS Code settings.

## How to Use Right Click Actions

Right click actions let you highlight a desired region of code, right click, and then select an action from the dropdown menu.

The highlighted code you’ve selected will be included in your prompt alongside a pre-written set of instructions depending on the selected action. This is the only section of code that the model will attempt to edit.

Right click actions that generate inline diffs use the same prompt and response processing logic as [Edit](../../features/edit/how-it-works).
