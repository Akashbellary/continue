Continue offers two ways to configure your AI assistants: Hub Assistants and Local Assistants (config.yaml).

You can easily access your assistant configuration from the Continue Chat sidebar. Open the sidebar by pressing <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> (VS Code) or <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (JetBrains) and click the Assistant selector above the main chat input. Then, you can hover over an assistant and click the `new window` (hub assistants) or `gear` (local assistants) icon.

## Hub Assistants

When you [sign in to Continue Hub](https://auth.continue.dev/), you get access to pre-configured assistants that sync automatically across your IDE sessions. To learn more about all the features available in Continue Hub, check out our [hub introduction](/hub/introduction). These assistants are:

- **Easy to set up** - Add an assistant from [hub.continue.dev](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/assistants) to your account
- **Managed online** - Configure models, add secrets, and customize settings through the web interface
- **Automatically synced** - Changes made on the hub reflect immediately in your IDE
- **Shareable** - Create and share custom assistants with your team

To use Hub assistants:

1. Click the assistant selector above the chat input in your IDE
2. Browse available assistants or create your own
3. Add API keys as [User Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets) on the hub
4. Click "Reload config" to sync changes

Hub Assistants can be managed in [the Hub](https://hub.continue.dev). See [Editing an Assistant](../../hub/assistants/edit-an-assistant.md) for more details.

## Local Assistants (config.yaml)

For advanced users who prefer local control, Continue supports configuration through a `config.yaml` file. Local assistants offer:

- **Full control** - All configuration stored locally on your machine
- **Version control friendly** - Check your config into git for team consistency
- **Offline usage** - No internet required once models are configured
- **Advanced customization** - Access to all configuration options

Local user-level configuration is stored and can be edited in your home directory in `config.yaml`:

- `~/.continue/config.yaml` (MacOS / Linux)
- `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.yaml` (Windows)

To open this `config.yaml`, you need to open the assistants dropdown in the top-right portion of the chat input. On that dropdown beside the "Local Assistant" option, select the cog icon. It will open the local `config.yaml`.

When editing this file, you can see the available options suggested as you type, or check the reference below. When you save a config file from the IDE, Continue will automatically refresh to take into account your changes. A config file is automatically created the first time you use Continue, and always automatically generated with default values if it doesn't exist.

See the full reference for `config.yaml` [here](/reference).

## Which Should You Use?

**Choose Hub assistants if you:**

- Want the quickest setup experience
- Prefer managing configuration through a web interface
- Want access to hosted models-addon
- Need to sync settings across multiple machines
- Want access to pre-configured assistants from the community

**Choose local config.yaml if you:**

- Need version control for your configuration
- Require advanced customization options
- Want complete offline control
- Prefer managing configuration as code

## Deprecated configuration methods

<Info>
  View the `config.json` migration guide [here](../yaml-migration.mdx)
</Info>

- [`config.json`](/reference) - The original configuration format which is stored in a file at the same location as `config.yaml`
- [`.continuerc.json`](#continuercjson) - Workspace-level configuration
- [`config.ts`](#configts) - Advanced configuration (probably unnecessary) - a TypeScript file in your home directory that can be used to programmatically modify (_merged_) the `config.json` schema:
  - `~/.continue/config.ts` (MacOS / Linux)
  - `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.ts` (Windows)

### `.continuerc.json`

The format of `.continuerc.json` is the same as `config.json`, plus one _additional_ property `mergeBehavior`, which can be set to either "merge" or "overwrite". If set to "merge" (the default), `.continuerc.json` will be applied on top of `config.json` (arrays and objects are merged). If set to "overwrite", then every top-level property of `.continuerc.json` will overwrite that property from `config.json`.

Example

```json title=".continuerc.json"
{
  "tabAutocompleteOptions": {
    "disable": true
  },
  "mergeBehavior": "overwrite"
}
```

### `config.ts`

`config.yaml` or `config.json` can handle the vast majority of necessary configuration, so we recommend using it whenever possible. However, if you need to programmatically extend Continue configuration, you can use a `config.ts` file, placed at `~/.continue/config.ts` (MacOS / Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.ts` (Windows).

`config.ts` must export a `modifyConfig` function, like:

```ts title="config.ts"
export function modifyConfig(config: Config): Config {
  config.slashCommands?.push({
    name: "commit",
    description: "Write a commit message",
    run: async function* (sdk) {
      // The getDiff function takes a boolean parameter that indicates whether
      // to include unstaged changes in the diff or not.
      const diff = await sdk.ide.getDiff(false); // Pass false to exclude unstaged changes
      for await (const message of sdk.llm.streamComplete(
        `${diff}\n\nWrite a commit message for the above changes. Use no more than 20 tokens to give a brief description in the imperative mood (e.g. 'Add feature' not 'Added feature'):`,
        new AbortController().signal,
        {
          maxTokens: 20,
        },
      )) {
        yield message;
      }
    },
  });
  return config;
}
```
