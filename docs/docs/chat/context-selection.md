## Highlighted code

The highlighted code youâ€™ve selected by pressing <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> (VS Code) or <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (JetBrains) will be included in your prompt alongside the input you provide. This is the only section of code that will be provided to the model unless you highlight additional sections or use one of the other selection methods below.

## Active file

You can include the currently open file as context by pressing <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> (Windows) when you send your request at Chat window(Prompt can't be empty).

You can include a folder in your current workspace as context by typing [`@Folder`](../advanced/context-integration/custom-providers#folder) and selecting the directory. It [works like `@Codebase`](../advanced/deep-dives/codebase.mdx) but only includes the files in the selected folder.
