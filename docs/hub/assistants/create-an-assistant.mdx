## Remix an agent

You should remix an agent if you want to use it after some modifications.

By clicking the “remix” button, you’ll be taken to the “Create a remix” page.

Once here, you’ll be able to

1. add or remove blocks in YAML configuration
2. change the name, description, icon, etc.

Clicking “Create agent” will make this agent available for use.

## Create an agent from scratch

To create an agent from scratch, select “New agent” in the top bar.

Choose a name, slug, description, and icon for your agent.

The easiest way to create an agent is to click "Create agent" with the default configuration and then add / remove blocks using the sidebar.

Alternatively, you can edit the agent YAML directly before clicking "Create agent". Refer to examples of agents on [hub.continue.dev](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/assistants) and visit the [YAML Reference](/reference#complete-yaml-config-example) docs for more details.
