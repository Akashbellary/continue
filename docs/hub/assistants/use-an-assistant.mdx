Once you've found the agent you want to use

1. Click “Add Agent” on its page
2. Add any required inputs (e.g. secrets like API keys)
3. Select “Save changes” in agent sidebar on the right hand side

After this, you can then go to your IDE extension and begin using the agent by selecting it from the agent dropdown.
