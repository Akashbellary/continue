<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Interactive Mode">
    Interactive mode (`cn` command) lets you have a back-and-forth conversation
    with Continue about your codebase. You can ask questions, get explanations,
    and request code changes.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Headless Mode">
    Headless mode (`-p` flag) is designed for automation and scripting. It
    allows you to run commands without user interaction, making it suitable for
    CI/CD pipelines and other automated workflows.
  </Tab>

## Get Started

Make sure you have [Continue CLI installed](/cli/install) and are in a project directory.

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-awesome-project

# Start Continue CLI in interactive mode
cn
```

This will launch an interactive chat session. You can also run commands directly in headless mode:

```bash
# Run a command in headless mode
cn -p "Fix lint issues in the src/ directory"
```
