**Continue enables developers to ship faster with Continuous AI.**

<Tip>
  Build features from descriptions. Debug and fix issues. Navigate any codebase.
  Automate tedious tasks.
</Tip>

## Get started in 30 seconds

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js 18 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- A [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev) account (recommended) or local configuration

```bash npm
# Install Continue CLI
npm install -g @continuedev/cli

# Navigate to your project

cd your-awesome-project

# Start coding with Continue

cn

# You'll be prompted to set up on first use

```

That's it! You're ready to start automating with Continue CLI.

## Why developers love Continue CLI

- **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Continue CLI meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
- **Takes action**: Continue CLI can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? Check out our [MCPs](/integrations/mcp).
- **Automate tasks**: Create issues from PostHog data, automatically assign labels to issues, and more. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
- **Flexible interfaces**: Use interactive mode for back-and-forth conversations, or headless mode for automation and scripting.

## Key Capabilities

### Context Engineering

- Use `@` to reference files and provide context
- Use `/` to run slash commands for specific tasks
- Access the same context providers as IDE extensions

### Tool Integration

- File editing and creation
- Terminal command execution
- Codebase understanding and analysis
- Git integration
- Web search and documentation access

### Model Flexibility

- Switch between models with `/model` command
- Use any model configured in your `config.yaml`
- Access Continue Hub models and configurations

## Continue Hub Integration

Continue CLI integrates seamlessly with [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev) for:

### API Access

Get an API key for automation workflows:

1. Visit [Continue Hub API Keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Use with `cn login` or in your automation scripts

### Secrets Management

Store secure credentials for CLI workflows:

1. Visit [Continue Hub Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets)
2. Add your API keys and sensitive data
3. Reference in configurations with `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`

### Configuration Sync

- Cloud-managed configurations automatically sync
- Share configurations across team members
- Version control for your AI workflows

## Common Use Cases

### Development Automation

<CodeGroup>
```bash Generate Commit Messages
# Generate commit messages
cn -p "Generate a conventional commit message for the current changes"
```

```bash Code Review
# Code review automation
cn -p "Review the current git changes for bugs and suggest improvements"
```

```bash Test Generation
# Test generation
cn "@src/utils.js Generate comprehensive unit tests for this file"
```

</CodeGroup>

### CI/CD Integration

<CodeGroup>
```bash Pipeline Scripts
# In your pipeline scripts
cn -p "Analyze test failures and suggest fixes" 
```

```bash Documentation Updates
# Automated documentation updates
cn "@README.md Update this documentation based on recent changes"
```

</CodeGroup>

### Codebase Analysis

<CodeGroup>
```bash Interactive Exploration
# Interactive exploration
cn
> @src/components Find all unused React components. How does authentication work in this codebase?
```

```bash Security Audits
# Security audits
cn -p "Scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities"
```
