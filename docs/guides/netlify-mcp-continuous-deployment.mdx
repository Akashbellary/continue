<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="rocket">
  A fully automated workflow that uses Continue CLI with Netlify MCP to create
  sites, deploy code changes, manage environment variables, and monitor
  deployments - all through natural language commands
</Card>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- GitHub repository with a web project (React, Vue, Next.js, etc.)
- Netlify account (free tier works)
- Node.js 22+ installed locally  
- Continue CLI account with **active credits** (required for API usage)
- Continue Hub account to install Netlify MCP

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Continue CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @continuedev/cli
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Netlify CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g netlify-cli
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up Continue CLI Account & API Key">
    1. Visit [Continue Organizations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/organizations)
    2. Sign up or log in to your Continue account
    3. Navigate to your organization settings
    4. Click **"API Keys"** and then **"+ New API Key"**
    5. Copy the API key immediately (you won't see it again!)
    6. Login to the CLI: `cn login`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Netlify MCP from Continue Hub">
    Visit [Netlify MCP on Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/netlify/netlify-mcp) and follow the installation instructions for your preferred editor, or add to your MCP config manually.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Netlify MCP gives Continue CLI direct access to Netlify's API and CLI
  commands, enabling powerful deployment automation through natural language!
</Tip>

## Step 1: Set Up Your Credentials

First, you'll need to gather your API credentials and configure both Netlify CLI and Continue CLI.

### Get Your Netlify Personal Access Token

1. Go to [Netlify Personal Access Tokens](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens)
2. Click **"New access token"**
3. Name it "Continue CLI Deployment"
4. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

### Authenticate Netlify CLI

```bash
netlify login
```

This will open your browser for authentication. Alternatively, you can use your Personal Access Token:

```bash
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="your-personal-access-token"
```

### Configure MCP with Netlify

Add Netlify MCP to your MCP configuration file (usually `~/.config/mcp/config.json` or similar):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "netlify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@netlify/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "NETLIFY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-pat-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  **Security Note**: Never commit your Personal Access Token to version control.
  Consider using environment variables or secure secret management.
</Warning>

### Test Your Setup

Use Continue CLI to verify Netlify MCP is working:

```bash
cn -p "Using the Netlify MCP server, please:
1. Check if I'm authenticated with Netlify
2. List my current Netlify sites (if any)
3. Show my Netlify account information
4. Confirm the MCP connection is working properly

Please provide a summary of the connection status and any sites found."
```

## Step 2: Create and Deploy Your First Site

Now you'll use Continue CLI with Netlify MCP to create a new site and deploy your project.

### Create a New Netlify Site

```bash
cn -p "Using Netlify MCP, I need to create and deploy a new site. Please:

1. Create a new Netlify site with these specifications:
   - Name: my-continue-cli-demo-{random-id}
   - Use the current directory as the project root
   - Detect the build settings automatically

2. Link the site to my current Git repository if one exists

3. Set up the following build configuration:
   - Build command: Detect automatically or use 'npm run build'
   - Publish directory: Detect automatically or use 'dist' or 'build'
   - Node version: 22.x

4. Deploy the site immediately after creation

5. Provide me with:
   - The site URL
   - The site ID for future reference
   - Build status
   - Any deployment logs

Please execute these steps and show me the results."
```

<Info>
  **What Netlify MCP Does:** 
  - Creates a new site in your Netlify account
  - Automatically detects framework settings (React, Vue, Next.js, etc.)
  - Links to your Git repository for continuous deployment
  - Triggers an initial deployment
  - Provides live site URL
</Info>

## Step 3: Manage Environment Variables

Use Continue CLI to manage your site's environment variables securely:

```bash
cn -p "Using Netlify MCP, help me manage environment variables for my site. Please:

1. List all current environment variables for site: {your-site-id}

2. Add these new environment variables:
   - API_KEY: 'demo-api-key-123'
   - NODE_ENV: 'production'
   - ENABLE_FEATURE_FLAGS: 'true'

3. Create these build-time only variables:
   - BUILD_TIMESTAMP: Current ISO timestamp
   - GIT_COMMIT_SHA: Latest commit SHA if available

4. Set up these sensitive variables (mark as secret):
   - DATABASE_URL: 'postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db'
   - JWT_SECRET: Generate a secure random string

5. Verify all variables are set correctly

6. Trigger a new deployment to apply the changes

Please execute these operations and confirm the environment variables are properly configured."
```

<Tip>
  Environment variables set through Netlify MCP are encrypted and only
  accessible during build time and runtime, keeping your secrets secure.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Set Up Continuous Deployment Workflow

Create an automated workflow that deploys on code changes and monitors build status.

### Create Deployment Automation Script

Create a file called `deploy-with-continue.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Deploy with Continue CLI and Netlify MCP
cn -p "Using Netlify MCP, perform a production deployment:

1. Check the current deployment status of my Netlify site

2. If there are uncommitted changes:
   - Show me what files have changed
   - Ask if I want to commit them first

3. Create a new deployment with:
   - Clear build cache if needed
   - Production context
   - Auto-publish enabled

4. Monitor the deployment:
   - Show build logs in real-time
   - Report any errors immediately
   - Notify when deployment is complete

5. After successful deployment:
   - Show the preview URL
   - Run basic smoke tests (check if site is accessible)
   - Report Core Web Vitals if available

6. If deployment fails:
   - Show error logs
   - Suggest potential fixes
   - Option to rollback to previous deployment

Please execute this deployment workflow and keep me updated on progress."
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x deploy-with-continue.sh
```

## Step 5: Advanced Netlify Operations

### Manage Multiple Environments

```bash
cn -p "Using Netlify MCP, help me set up a staging environment:

1. Create a branch deploy for 'staging' branch:
   - Enable automatic deploys from staging branch
   - Use different environment variables for staging
   - Create unique URL: staging--{site-name}.netlify.app

2. Set up deploy previews:
   - Enable for all pull requests
   - Add comment to PR with preview URL
   - Run tests on preview deploys

3. Configure split testing:
   - Create A/B test between main and staging
   - Split traffic 50/50
   - Track performance metrics

Please set up these deployment environments and provide the configuration details."
```

### Enable Netlify Functions

```bash
cn -p "Using Netlify MCP, help me set up serverless functions:

1. Enable Netlify Functions for my site

2. Create a sample function at netlify/functions/hello-world.js:
   - Simple JSON response
   - Handle GET and POST requests
   - Include CORS headers

3. Create an API endpoint function at netlify/functions/api.js:
   - Connect to environment variables
   - Handle multiple routes
   - Include error handling

4. Deploy the functions and provide:
   - Function endpoints
   - Invocation URLs
   - Test commands

Please set up these serverless functions and show me how to invoke them."
```

### Set Up Form Handling

```bash
cn -p "Using Netlify MCP, configure form handling for my site:

1. Enable Netlify Forms

2. Set up form notifications:
   - Email notifications to: admin@example.com
   - Webhook to: https://api.example.com/form-webhook
   - Slack notifications if possible

3. Configure spam filtering:
   - Enable reCAPTCHA
   - Set up honeypot field
   - Configure Akismet if available

4. Create form submission handling:
   - Store submissions in Netlify
   - Export endpoint for submissions
   - Set up auto-response emails

Please configure these form features and provide integration instructions."
```

## Step 6: Monitoring and Analytics

### Set Up Deployment Monitoring

```bash
cn -p "Using Netlify MCP, help me monitor my site's performance:

1. Get deployment analytics:
   - Build times over last 30 days
   - Success/failure rate
   - Average deploy time

2. Check current site metrics:
   - Bandwidth usage
   - Request count
   - Form submission count

3. Set up monitoring alerts:
   - Build failures
   - High bandwidth usage
   - Form spam detection

4. Generate a deployment report:
   - Last 10 deployments
   - Git commits for each
   - Build duration trends

Please gather this monitoring data and create a comprehensive report."
```

## Step 7: GitHub Actions Integration

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that uses Continue CLI with Netlify MCP for automated deployments.

### Add GitHub Secrets

1. Go to **Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Add these secrets:
   - `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key
   - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Netlify Personal Access Token
   - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: Your Netlify site ID

### Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/netlify-deploy.yml`:

```yaml
