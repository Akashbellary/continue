<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="shield-halved">
  An automated security scanning system that uses Continue's AI agent with Snyk
  MCP to identify vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, infrastructure, and
  containers - all through simple natural language prompts
</Card>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Continue account with **Hub access**
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- [Snyk account](https://snyk.io/) (free tier works)
- A local project to scan for vulnerabilities

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Snyk MCP via Continue Hub">
    Visit the [Snyk MCP on Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/snyk/snyk-mcp) and click **Install** to add it to your Continue account.

    The Hub listing automatically configures the MCP command:
    ```bash
    npx -y snyk@latest mcp -t stdio
    ```

    <Info>
      The MCP will request authentication and folder trust permissions when first used.
      This is handled automatically by the Continue agent.
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Secure-at-Inception Rules">
    Install the [Snyk Secure-at-Inception rules](https://hub.continue.dev/snyk/secure-at-inception) from the Hub to enable automatic security scanning.

    These rules configure your agent to:
    - **Run [SAST](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/sast/) scans** on newly generated or modified code
    - **Check dependencies** when adding or updating packages
    - **Auto-fix issues** using Snyk's recommendations, then rescan

  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate with Snyk">
    Run this command with your Continue agent to set up authentication:

    ```bash
    "Check Snyk auth status. If not authenticated, authenticate me and confirm my org context."
    ```

    <Tip>
      A browser window will open for Snyk login. After authenticating, approve
      the request to trust your project folder when prompted.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Scanning Recipes

Now you can use natural language prompts to run comprehensive security scans. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate Snyk MCP tools.

<Info>
  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before running security scans that might make changes,
  test your prompts in plan mode (press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes). This shows you
  what the agent will do without executing it. For example:
  `"Run a Snyk Code scan and fix the top 3 issues"`
</Info>

### Code Vulnerability Scanning ([SAST](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/sast/))

<Card title="Static Application Security Testing" icon="code">
  Scan your source code for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

```bash
"Run a Snyk Code scan on this repo with severity threshold medium.
Summarize issues with file:line. Propose minimal diffs for the top 3
and rerun to verify."
```

</Card>

### Dependency Scanning ([SCA](https://snyk.io/learn/software-composition-analysis-sca/))

<Card title="Software Composition Analysis" icon="cube">
  Check open source dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

```bash
"Run Snyk Open Source on this repo (include dev deps).
Summarize vulnerable paths and propose a minimal-risk upgrade plan.
Re-test after the plan (dry run)."
```

</Card>

### Infrastructure as Code ([IaC](https://snyk.io/learn/infrastructure-as-code-iac/))

<Card title="IaC Security" icon="cloud">
  Scan Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes configs for misconfigurations.

```bash
"Scan ./infra with Snyk IaC. Report high/critical misconfigs
with exact files/lines. Provide code changes and re-scan to confirm."
```

</Card>

### Container Scanning

<Card title="Container Security" icon="docker">
  Analyze Docker images for vulnerabilities in base images and packages.

```bash
"Scan image my-api:latest. Exclude base image vulns.
Print dependency tree. Recommend a safer base image or upgrades.
Re-test after the change (dry run)."
```

</Card>

### Pull Request Scanning

<Card title="Changed Files Only" icon="code-branch">
  Focus scanning on modified files to catch issues before merging.

```bash
"Scan only files changed since origin/main with Snyk Code.
Block if new high issues would be introduced. Show deltas."
```

</Card>

### Security Learning

<Card title="Snyk Learn Integration" icon="graduation-cap">
  Access security education resources based on identified vulnerabilities ([CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/)).

```bash
"Open Snyk Learn lessons related to the top CWE(s) from this scan."
```

</Card>

## Continuous Security with GitHub Actions

Automate security scanning in your CI/CD pipeline using Continue CLI and Snyk MCP.

### Add GitHub Secrets

Navigate to **Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions** and add:

- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)

### Create Workflow File

Create `.github/workflows/snyk-security.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Security Scanning with Snyk MCP

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 8 * * *" # Daily at 8 AM UTC

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "18"

      - name: Install Continue CLI
        run: |
          npm install -g @continuedev/cli
          echo "‚úÖ Continue CLI installed"

      - name: Authenticate Continue CLI
        run: |
          cn auth login --api-key "${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}"
          echo "‚úÖ Continue CLI authenticated"

      - name: Run Security Scans
        run: |
          echo "üîç Running code vulnerability scan..."
          cn -p "Run Snyk Code scan with severity high on this repo.
                 Fail if any high issues are present."

          echo "üì¶ Checking dependencies..."
          cn -p "Run Snyk Open Source on this repo.
                 Fail on fixable high issues."

      - name: Generate Security Report
        if: always()
        run: |
          cn -p "Generate a markdown security report summarizing:
                 - Total vulnerabilities by severity
                 - Top 3 critical issues (if any)
                 - Recommended next steps
                 Save to security-report.md"

      - name: Upload Security Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: security-report-${{ github.run_number }}
          path: security-report.md
          retention-days: 30
```

<Info>
  The Snyk MCP authentication is handled through Continue Hub. No need to manage
  Snyk tokens directly in CI - the agent manages authentication.
</Info>

## Security Guardrails

Implement automated security policies using Continue's rule system. See the [Rules deep dive](/customize/deep-dives/rules) for authoring tips.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pre-commit Scanning" icon="lock">
    ```bash
    "Always run Snyk Code before committing newly
    generated code; refuse to proceed if high
    issues remain."
    ```
  </Card>

<Card title="Dependency Safety" icon="shield-check">
  ```bash
  "When adding/updating a dependency, run Snyk Open Source, choose the
  lowest-risk upgrade, and re-test."
  ```
</Card>

<Card title="Container Hardening" icon="box">
  ```bash
  "Before building containers, scan base images and recommend
  security-hardened alternatives."
  ```
</Card>

  <Card title="IaC Compliance" icon="clipboard-list">
    ```bash
    "Scan all Terraform changes for compliance
    violations before applying infrastructure."
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Enable the **Secure-at-Inception** rules from the Hub to automatically apply
  these guardrails to all code generation and modifications.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

```bash
"Check Snyk auth status and current org. If not authenticated,
help me authenticate. Then run a quick Code scan on ./
with severity medium and print one example issue."
```

### Fix Validation

```bash
"Propose minimal diffs only in affected files,
then rerun the same Snyk scan to confirm resolution."
```

### Connection Problems

<Check>
  **Verification Steps:** - Snyk MCP is installed via [Continue
  Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/snyk/snyk-mcp) - Secure-at-Inception rules are
  [enabled](https://hub.continue.dev/snyk/secure-at-inception) - Authentication
  completed successfully - Project folder has been trusted
</Check>
