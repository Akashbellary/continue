[Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev) makes it simple to create custom AI code [assistants](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/assistants/intro), providing a registry for defining, managing, and sharing assistant [building blocks](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/blocks/intro).
Assistants can contain several types of blocks, including [models](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/blocks/block-types#models), [rules](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/blocks/block-types#rules), [context providers](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/blocks/block-types#context), [prompts](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/blocks/block-types#prompts), [docs](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/blocks/block-types#docs), [data destinations](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/blocks/block-types#data), and [MCP servers](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/blocks/block-types#mcp-servers).

Continue Hub also makes it easy for engineering leaders to centrally [configure](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/secrets/secret-types) and [govern](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/governance/org-permissions) blocks and assistants for their organization.
